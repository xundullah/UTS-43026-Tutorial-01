    "### **Definition of Marginal Cost**\n",
    "The **Marginal Cost (MC)** is the additional cost incurred by producing **one more unit** of the product. Mathematically, it is defined as the **derivative of the total cost function** with respect to \\( q \\):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MC(q) = \\frac{dC(q)}{dq}\n",

    "### **Why is Marginal Cost Important?**\n",
    "- It helps in **pricing decisions** by determining the cost of additional production.\n",
    "- It is crucial in **profit maximization**, as businesses aim to produce where **marginal cost equals marginal revenue**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Calculation of Marginal Cost**\n",
    "Given the cost function:\n",

    "Applying the **power rule**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "MC(q) = 2(25)q^{2-1} + 2000(1)q^{1-1}\n",

    "### **Interpretation of Marginal Cost**\n",
    "- The function **\\( MC(q) = 50q + 2000 \\)** means:\n",
    "  - **For each additional unit produced, the cost increases by \\( 50q \\)**.\n",
    "  - There is a **fixed cost component of 2000**, meaning production always incurs at least this amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the **marginal cost function** is:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Revenue (R)** is the total money earned from selling the product. It is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### **Why Revenue Matters?**\n",
    "- It helps businesses determine their **total earnings**.\n",
    "- A company maximizes revenue when **marginal revenue equals marginal cost**.\n",
    "\n",

    "- The profit function follows a **quadratic trend**.\n",
    "- As production **increases, profit grows quadratically**.\n",
    "- The cancellation of \\( 2000q \\) suggests that revenue and cost increase at the same rate in the linear term.\n",

    "## **Key Takeaways**\n",
    "1. **Marginal Cost Insights:**\n",
    "   - Marginal cost represents **how total cost changes with production**.\n",
    "   - A **higher marginal cost** indicates diminishing returns or increased production costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Revenue Insights:**\n",
    "   - Revenue depends on **price and quantity**.\n",
    "   - Selling at **marginal cost ensures revenue is maximized**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Profit Insights:**\n",
    "   - Profit is purely dependent on \\( q^2 \\), meaning higher production **exponentially increases profits**.\n",
    "   - The absence of a linear term means **no direct constant profit per unit**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Business Implication:**\n",
    "   - The manufacturer should aim to **maximize production** as long as **demand is sufficient**.\n",
    "   - The quadratic nature of profit suggests that **higher production leads to exponential profits**.\n",

    "## **Conclusion**\n",
    "Understanding **marginal cost, revenue, and profit** helps manufacturers make **data-driven decisions** about **pricing, production, and profitability**. In this case:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Marginal cost determines the price.**\n",
    "- **Revenue depends on the price and quantity.**\n",
    "- **Profit is maximized by increasing production.**\n",
