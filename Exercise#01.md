# **Exercise 01: Marginal Cost, Revenue, and Profit Calculation**

A manufacturer estimates that the following function represents the **total variable cost** for manufacturing a product:

\[
C(q) = 25q^2 + 2000q
\]

where:
- \( C(q) \) represents the **total cost** of producing \( q \) units of the product.
- \( q \) is the **quantity** of products manufactured.

We will derive expressions for:
1. **Marginal Cost (MC)** â€“ the additional cost of producing one more unit.
2. **Revenue (R)** â€“ the total money earned from selling the products.
3. **Profit (\(\Pi\))** â€“ the total earnings after deducting costs from revenue.

---

## **Step 1: Marginal Cost Calculation**

### **Definition of Marginal Cost**
The **Marginal Cost (MC)** is the additional cost incurred by producing **one more unit** of the product. Mathematically, it is the **derivative of the total cost function** with respect to \( q \):

\[
MC(q) = \frac{dC(q)}{dq}
\]

### **Why is Marginal Cost Important?**
- It helps in **pricing decisions** by determining the cost of additional production.
- It is crucial in **profit maximization**, as businesses aim to produce where **marginal cost equals marginal revenue**.

Now, substituting the given cost function:

\[
C(q) = 25q^2 + 2000q
\]

Taking the **derivative** with respect to \( q \):

\[
MC(q) = \frac{d}{dq} (25q^2 + 2000q)
\]

Applying the **power rule**:

\[
MC(q) = 2(25)q^{2-1} + 2000(1)q^{1-1}
\]

\[
MC(q) = 50q + 2000
\]

### **Interpretation of Marginal Cost**
- The function **\( MC(q) = 50q + 2000 \)** means:
  - **For each additional unit produced, the cost increases by \( 50q \)**.
  - There is a **fixed cost component of 2000**, meaning production always incurs at least this amount.

Thus, the **marginal cost function** is:

\[
MC(q) = 50q + 2000
\]

---

## **Step 2: Revenue Calculation**

### **Definition of Revenue**
**Revenue (R)** is the total money earned from selling the product. It is given by:

\[
R = \text{Price per unit} \times \text{Quantity sold}
\]

Since the widgets are sold at **marginal cost**, the selling price per unit \( \pi \) is:

\[
\pi = MC(q)
\]

Thus, the revenue function becomes:

\[
R(q) = \pi \cdot q = (50q + 2000)q
\]

Expanding:

\[
R(q) = 50q^2 + 2000q
\]

### **Why Revenue Matters?**
- It helps businesses determine their **total earnings**.
- A company maximizes revenue when **marginal revenue equals marginal cost**.

Thus, the **revenue function** is:

\[
R(q) = 50q^2 + 2000q
\]

---

## **Step 3: Profit Calculation**

### **Definition of Profit**
**Profit (\(\Pi\))** is the difference between **total revenue** and **total cost**:

\[
\Pi(q) = R(q) - C(q)
\]

### **Why Profit is Important?**
- A business operates to **maximize profit**.
- Profit indicates the **financial health** and **sustainability** of production.

Substituting the expressions:

\[
\Pi(q) = (50q^2 + 2000q) - (25q^2 + 2000q)
\]

### **Step-by-Step Simplification**
Expanding the subtraction:

\[
\Pi(q) = 50q^2 + 2000q - 25q^2 - 2000q
\]

Rearrange the terms:

\[
\Pi(q) = (50q^2 - 25q^2) + (2000q - 2000q)
\]

\[
\Pi(q) = 25q^2 + 0
\]

\[
\Pi(q) = 25q^2
\]

### **Interpretation of Profit**
- The profit function follows a **quadratic trend**.
- As production **increases, profit grows quadratically**.
- The cancellation of \( 2000q \) suggests that revenue and cost increase at the same rate in the linear term.

Thus, the **profit function** is:

\[
\Pi(q) = 25q^2
\]

---

## **Final Summary**
1. **Marginal Cost Function:**  
   \[
   MC(q) = 50q + 2000
   \]
   - Measures the **additional cost per unit produced**.

2. **Revenue Function:**  
   \[
   R(q) = 50q^2 + 2000q
   \]
   - Represents **total earnings** based on production.

3. **Profit Function:**  
   \[
   \Pi(q) = 25q^2
   \]
   - Shows that **profit increases quadratically** with production.

## **Key Takeaways**
1. **Marginal Cost Insights:**
   - Marginal cost represents **how total cost changes with production**.
   - A **higher marginal cost** indicates diminishing returns or increased production costs.

2. **Revenue Insights:**
   - Revenue depends on **price and quantity**.
   - Selling at **marginal cost ensures revenue is maximized**.

3. **Profit Insights:**
   - Profit is purely dependent on \( q^2 \), meaning higher production **exponentially increases profits**.
   - The absence of a linear term means **no direct constant profit per unit**.

4. **Business Implication:**
   - The manufacturer should aim to **maximize production** as long as **demand is sufficient**.
   - The quadratic nature of profit suggests that **higher production leads to exponential profits**.

---

## **Conclusion**
Understanding **marginal cost, revenue, and profit** helps manufacturers make **data-driven decisions** about **pricing, production, and profitability**. In this case:

- **Marginal cost determines the price.**
- **Revenue depends on the price and quantity.**
- **Profit is maximized by increasing production.**
